For this article you should focus on the findings reported in sections 3.1 and 3.2. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> A series of one-way ANOVAs were performed with condition (standard vs. keyboard delay) as the factor and transcription fluency, lexical sophistication, subjective fluency, and essay quality as the dependent variables.

> 3.1. Descriptive essay indices

> Condition affected transcription fluency such that it was more fluent in the standard condition, F(1, 197) = 110.14, MSE = 2796.13, p < 0.001, d = 1.50. While there were more words typed in the standard condition, F(1, 198) = 6.35, MSE = 14329.49, p = 0.013, d = 0.36, essays in the delay condition contained longer words (letters and syllables per word), Fs > 4.17, ps < 0.043, ds > 0.28. There were no other differences (see Table 1).

> 3.2. Lexical sophistication

> Condition had a significant effect on type-token ratio, F(1, 198) = 9.70, MSE = 0.002, p = 0.002, d = 0.44, and vocd-D (marginally), F(1, 198) = 3.29, MSE = 264.62, p = 0.071, d = 0.26, such that they were higher in the delay condition. There was no effect on the measure of textual lexical diversity, F(1, 198) = 2.13, MSE = 239.96, p = 0.146, d = 0.21, though the pattern of means was in the same direction. Moreover, condition had an effect on both word frequency indices such that they were lower in the delay condition, log word frequency-all words, F(1, 198) = 4.49, MSE = 0.01, p = 0.035, d = 0.30, raw word frequency-content words, F(1, 198) = 4.74, MSE = 0.02, p = 0.031, d = 0.31 (see Table 2). The results were similar when lexical diversity and word frequency from TAACO and TAALES were used (see Table 3).
